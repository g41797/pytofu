# Session State: pytofu Porting

## Resumption Protocol
**IMPORTANT:** At the start of every new session, the AI MUST:
1.  Read `porting/MANDATORY-RULES.md` to understand roles and Git prohibitions.
2.  Read `porting/MASTER-PLAN.md` for the long-term roadmap.
3.  Read `porting/NEGOTIATION-GUIDELINES.md` for the interaction protocol.
4.  Read this file (`porting/SESSION-STATE.md`) for the immediate task.
5.  Read `porting/FOR-PARTICIPANTS.md` for general instructions applicable to any participating AI.


## Current Phase
- **Phase 1: Core Data Structures**

## Accomplishments (Current Session)
- Established mandatory rules and AI role as Mentor/Assistant.
- Migrated and organized architectural documentation from previous sessions.
- Created `MASTER-PLAN.md` and `NEGOTIATION-GUIDELINES.md`.
- Consolidated all coordination files in `/home/g41797/dev/root/github.com/g41797/pytofu/porting`.

## Blockers / Open Issues
- None.

## Next Step

- **Action:** Negotiate the implementation of `src/tofu/opcode.py` in `porting/NEGOTIATION.md`.

- **Reference:** `porting/specifications/opcode.md` and `porting/NEGOTIATION.md`.
