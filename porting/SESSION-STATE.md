# Session State: pytofu Porting

## Resumption Protocol
**IMPORTANT:** At the start of every new session, the AI MUST:
1.  Read `porting/MANDATORY-RULES.md` to understand roles and Git prohibitions.
2.  Read `porting/MASTER-PLAN.md` for the long-term roadmap.
3.  Read `porting/NEGOTIATION-GUIDELINES.md` for the interaction protocol.
4.  Read this file (`porting/SESSION-STATE.md`) for the immediate task.

## Current Phase
- **Phase 1: Core Data Structures**

## Accomplishments (Current Session)
