Manual publishing from local repo

  Test PyPI first (recommended)
      twine upload --repository testpypi dist/* 

  Then production PyPI
        twine upload dist/*     

Created two workflows:

    On PyPI, go to your project’s “Settings” -> “Publishing” section.
    Use “Add a new trusted publisher.”
    Select “GitHub Actions,” and enter:
        Repository: g41797/pytofu
        Workflow: .github/workflows/publish.yml
    Save the trusted publisher.

This links your repository to PyPI as a trusted publisher. Future runs of this workflow will be able to upload to PyPI using GitHub’s OIDC token. No code changes to your publish.yml are required unless your workflow filename or repository changes.
